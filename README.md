There is 2 modes: Training and Playing Game

To Train set `TRAIN_PPO = True`
To Play set `TRAIN_PPO = False` and `PLAY_NN =  True` to use NN or `PLAY_NN =  False` to play from the code randomly.

Run ./nnsoak.cpp
After ./exportW.py to create the compressed weight to use.
Look at the code to use different NN, and change.
